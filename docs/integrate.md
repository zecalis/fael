# Integrate fael into an agent

fael needs four calls from an agent's lifecycle. Each is one process spawn:
Event JSON on stdin, Reply JSON on stdout, always exit 0 (about 2–3 ms each; `session-start` about 10 ms
because it runs one `git check-ignore`). Claude Code and Codex use a built-in adapter
(`--client claude|codex`), and OpenCode gets a generated plugin
([`fael/skill/opencode.js`](../fael/skill/opencode.js), the reference implementation of
this page). Any other agent calls the neutral format:

```
fael hook <stop|session-start|read|edit>   < Event   > Reply

Event  {"cwd": str, "session": str, "client": str, "files": [str], "stop_active": bool, "text": str}
Reply  {"block": bool, "reason"?: str, "context"?: str}
```

| When | Call | Send | Do with the Reply |
|---|---|---|---|
| session starts | `session-start` | `cwd`, `session` | put `context` in the system prompt / first turn |
| a file was read | `read` | `cwd`, `session`, `files` | append `context` to the tool result |
| a file was written | `edit` | `cwd`, `session`, `files` | append `context` to the tool result |
| the agent is about to end its turn | `stop` | `cwd`, `session`, `text`, `stop_active` | `block` → do not end; send `reason` back to the model as the next message |

- `session` — an RFC 3339 time the session started (`2026-09-25T10:00:00.000Z`), or a transcript
  file whose birthtime is the start. **Send the exact same string to `read`, `edit` and `stop`**: it keys the
  session's edit list, stop blocks when files were edited after the newest row, and the read/edit push
  says each row once per session — without it every read re-pushes the same rows at full budget.
- `files` — absolute, or relative to `cwd`. Paths outside the repo are dropped.
- `text` — the assistant's text in this session (or at least the last message). The issue rule
  looks for "found a bug", "inconsistent", "might break", and similar; leave it out and fael reads `session` as a Claude transcript.
- `stop_active` — `true` when this stop comes right after one you blocked, so it never loops.
  fael also blocks each problem only once per session.
- `client` — a name for `fael stats`.

Any error, missing field or repo without `.fael/` is `{"block": false}`. Integration cannot break the agent.

Also register `fael mcp` (stdio, tools `find` / `add` / `close`). If the agent can load skills,
use the one `fael install` writes (`~/.claude/skills/fael/SKILL.md`).

## One worktree per agent

Two agents (or two sessions) sharing one worktree folder share its HEAD and index with no
coordination: one checks out its branch and the other is suddenly on the wrong branch, so its
next push or PR targets work it never meant to touch. fael does not guard this — it is a log,
not a daemon, and each row already records the branch it was filed on. The fix is structural:
give each agent its own worktree (`git worktree add ../wt-<agent>`) and never run two agents in
the same one. `fael find --branches` reads the other worktree's unmerged rows without checking
anything out, and `fael doctor` flags local branches whose PR already merged (`[Merged]`) for
deletion.
