# Contributing to fael

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zecalis/fael.git
cd fael
cargo test --workspace
```

Rust 1.89 or newer. The workspace has two crates: `fael-core` (log format, find, rules — no git,
no cwd) and `fael` (CLI, MCP server, hooks, install).

### Fast test loop

`cargo test` runs one test binary at a time. [nextest](https://nexte.st) runs them all in
parallel, one process per test — about 3 s for the whole workspace instead of 15 s:

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
cargo nextest run --workspace
```

While iterating, run only the suite or test you are touching (under a second):

```bash
cargo nextest run -p fael --test write            # one suite
cargo nextest run -p fael -E 'test(typo)'         # tests matching a name
```

Tests that spawn the binary pass `FAEL_STATE_DIR` to the child with `Command::env`, never
`std::env::set_var` — the env is process-global, so setting it forces every test in the
binary behind a lock and plain `cargo test` goes serial.

For a manual run, `FAEL_DIR=<scratch>` redirects the whole log (tree and journal) so a wrong
cwd cannot write into a shared `.fael`; `FAEL_STATE_DIR` only moves usage stats.

### Tests must build and run on Windows

CI runs the suite on Linux and macOS for every PR, and on Windows too once it lands on `main`
(Windows is best effort: its run takes the longest, so a Windows-only break shows on `main` and
the next PR fixes it). Two rules:

- **No fake binaries on `PATH`.** A shell-script fake needs a shebang and `chmod`, and Windows
  `CreateProcess` never resolves a `.bat` fake off `PATH`. Stub an external tool through an env
  seam the code reads instead, the way `FAEL_GH_JSON` stands in for `gh`.
- **Unix-only APIs gate the whole test.** Anything from `std::os::unix` goes in a test marked
  `#[cfg(unix)]` (see `fael/tests/install.rs`). Do not gate single lines inside a shared test.

## Before submitting

The same checks CI runs:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
scripts/file-size.sh              # no .rs file over 400 lines
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

Also type-check for Windows, so a stray `std::os::unix` fails here instead of in CI.
It needs no MSVC linker and takes a few seconds. `--no-default-features` drops the
bundled SQLite: its C cannot be compiled for Windows from macOS or Linux, and the Rust
lints the same without it (CI's Windows job and the release build bundle it natively):

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc   # once
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --no-default-features -- -D warnings
```

- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:`
- **One concern per commit**
- Open the PR against `main` from your branch; merging is the maintainer's call

## Project rules

- **Hooks stay fast** — every hook is a process spawn on every tool call (under 10 ms on a repo with ~1,500 rows, `session-start` about 45 ms once per session — measured with `hyperfine -N`).
  Measure with `hyperfine` before and after anything that touches the hook path.
- **Hooks fail open** — `fael hook …` always exits 0 and never blocks an agent because fael itself broke.
- **The log format is a contract** — [docs/format.md](docs/format.md) is versioned; a change there is
  a spec change, not a refactor. `.fael/` holds shared project data only; per-machine runtime state
  lives in `~/.local/state/fael/`.
- **Rules live in core, clients live in adapters** — see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
  Adding a client touches only an adapter.
- **No abstraction for abstraction's sake** — no interface with one implementation, no scaffolding
  for a future that may not come.
- **Prefer std** — a new dependency needs a reason a few lines of code can't cover.

## File size: no god files

fael pushes memory **per file** — an agent that reads a small file gets the rows about that file
and nothing else. A 1 000-line file makes every read expensive and every pushed row vague. So:

- **400 lines per `.rs` file, 100 per function.** `scripts/file-size.sh` and clippy
  `too_many_lines` enforce both in CI — run them before a commit.
- **Past the limit, split `x.rs` into `x.rs` + `x/`** the way `fael-core/src/query/` is:
  `x.rs` stays a thin entry (`mod` + `pub use` + a doc line naming each child), the children are
  private. Public paths never change — callers and tests keep `fael_core::name`.
- **Tests with more than one file:** `tests/<suite>/main.rs` + siblings (see `fael-core/tests/spec/`),
  never `#[path]`. Shared helpers in `common.rs` next to `main.rs`.
- **After a split, move the memory with it:** `fael mv <old> <new>` for each new file that took over
  a topic the rows are about (one old path can point at several new ones). Git's rename detection
  only catches a whole-file move.
- The allowlist in `scripts/file-size.sh` is a ratchet: those files may shrink, never grow.
  Delete a line once the file is split; never raise a number to get a commit through.

## Releasing (maintainers)

```bash
scripts/release.sh          # 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
scripts/release.sh minor    # 0.0.2 -> 0.1.0
```

It bumps `fael/Cargo.toml`, commits `release vX.Y.Z` on `main`, tags it and pushes. The tag runs
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds every platform and publishes the GitHub Release, npm
`@zecalis/fael` and the Homebrew formula together.
